		<p>This past Saturday the VUSL home team faced off in an exhibition match against C.D Aguiluchos USA a team from the city of Oakland California. The game which was scheduled to start at 4:30pm started right on time. The general public was not allowed to enter Chuckchansi Stadium till fifteen minutes or so before kickoff, perhaps in the future they will allow fans to enter up to an hour early in order to avoid having fans wait in line, while the match is underway.</p>
<p>Even though there were strong possibilities for rain that evening, the weather was spectacular for the two soccer events of the night. There were concession stand’s open that were serving Me-N-Ed’s pizza slices, which personally, tasted pretty good, but was really greasy and cheesy. Among other items such as Tecate Beers, Fountain Drinks, Cotton Candy, and Nachos were the most apparent items.</p>
<p>The first half of the match was one that was predominately fought in the middle of the pitch by both teams. There would be moments when C.D Aguiluchos USA would build up play from the defensive line to the outside midfielders who would then proceed with a skills move play to beat the left and right backs from VUSL’s defensive line. VUSL would counter the attack of their opponents by having their backline filter play to the midfielders, who would then proceed to feed long filter plays to their strikers.</p>
<p>Although, C.D Aguiluchos USA was the team that came knocking first, it was Moises Martinez for VUSL around the 30th minute that netted the first goal of the night. With 3 minutes left before the half, C.D Aguiluchos USA was able to come back and tie the game. The left back for VUSL got beat in a play that resulted in a cross and a header connecting for the 1-1 score by half time.</p>
<p>The second half started out pretty similar to the first half, C.D Aguiluchos USA would attempt to build up play with passing, and VUSL would counter with through filtered ball play to the two forwards, and striker. This time it would be C.D Aguiluchos USA who would respond first in the seonnd half. It wasn’t until coach Alex Rodas makes use of his super subs to put pressure on the Oakland team that VUSL became more aggressive in creating goal play opportunities. Thank’s to a superb shot by Flavio Ramos, VUSL was able to rescue the tie.<br /><br /><img src="images/vuslgallery/vusl11.jpg" alt="" /></p> 	</div>
